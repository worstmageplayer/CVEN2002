% MATLAB code to solve the boundary value problem using shooting method with bisection and RK4

% Parameters
l = 83;          % length in cm
T = 500;         % tension in kg
p = 120;         % distributed load in kg/cm
R = 50e6;        % flexural stiffness in kg*cm^2
n = 100;         % number of steps for RK4
tol = 1e-8;      % tolerance for bisection

% Initial guesses for z(0) = dw/dx at x=0
% Chosen based on physical approximation: around the pure beam slope 0.057, with bracket for sign change

z_high = 0.1;

% Define the ODE system: dy/dx = [y(2); (T/R)*y(1) + (p/(2*R))*x*(x - l)]
% Use anonymous function for the derivative
ode = @(x, y) [y(2); (T/R)*y(1) + (p/(2*R))*x*(x - l)];

% Function to integrate with RK4 and get w(l)

        k4 = ode(x + h, y + h * k3);
        y = y + h/6 * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4);
        x = x + h;
    end
    w_end = y(1);

% Bisection to find z0 such that w(l) = 0

if sign(f_low) == sign(f_high)

% Now integrate again to find w at l/2

% 1. The system of first-order ODEs:
%    dw/dx = z
%    dz/dx = (T/R) w + p x (x - l) / (2 R)

% 2. Initial guesses for z(0): 0.05 and 0.1
%    These are chosen around the physical approximation for a beam without tension, which is about 0.057.
%    They bracket the root since w(l) changes sign between them.

% 3. The deflection at midpoint w(l/2) with 8 digits: 1.47275743

% Explanation: The problem is a boundary value problem solved using the shooting method.
% We guess the initial slope z(0) and integrate using RK4 to x=l, adjusting the guess via bisection until w(l)â‰ˆ0.
% The midpoint deflection is extracted during the integration with the optimal z(0).
% The solution arrives by numerically solving the ODE system, with the bisection ensuring the boundary condition is met to the specified tolerance.
